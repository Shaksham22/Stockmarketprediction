# Stockmarketprediction
I created this project for my Research Methodologies course where I created a portal that assists me with stock market investment using simple classification of Nifty50 stockmarket index and equities into Buy Sell and Hold based on stock prices and interest rate. The image below shows the UI of the portal.

The backend runs on flask that fetches data from a pretrained machine learning model to classify the stocks into Buy Sell and Hold.
