# Stockmarketprediction
I created this project for my Research Methodologies course where I developed a portal to assist with stock market investment. The portal provides simple classification of the Nifty50 stock market index and equities into Buy, Sell, and Hold categories based on stock prices and interest rates. The image below shows the UI of the portal.

The backend runs on Flask, fetching data from a pretrained machine learning model to classify the stocks into Buy, Sell, and Hold.
